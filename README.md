# Zeno3D
A rewritten and optimized version of Module3D V4 by [@TheNexusAvenger](https://github.com/TheNexusAvenger).

Zeno3D restores and improves Module3D V4, offering full control over 3D rendering without relying on ViewportFrames. It provides high customizability, simplicity, intuitive and ***super easy*** usage for advanced UI-based 3D visualization

## Benchmark
Benchmarks were run using 10 models on screen, each containing 1600 parts (totaling ***16,000 parts*** rendered in ***real time***). All tests were performed with Roblox graphics set to maximum in an empty Baseplate with **Anchored** models. Results may vary depending on your hardware.

## Code Examples
```luau
-- Requiring module
local Zeno3D = require(path.to.Zone3D)

-- Getting the model and GUI object (can be any GuiObject: Frame, ImageButton, etc.)
local Model = workspace.CarModel
local Frame = game.StarterGui.ScreenGui.ExampleFrame

-- Creating the controller
local Controller = Zeno3D:Attach3D(Model, Frame)
Controller:SetActive(true) -- Required to display the model on screen
Controller:SetDepth(3) -- Brings the model 3x closer to the player's camera
Controller:SetCFrame(CFrame.Angles(0, math.rad(180), 0)) -- Rotate the model (recommended: use CFrame.Angles)
```

## API Usage
### Methods
`Controller:MakeJoints()`\
Automatically weld the entire model. Recommended to call it before or exactly after you Unanchor the model. ***If your unanchored model are not showing on screen, consider using it***.

`Controller:SetCollisionGroup(groupName: string)`\
Sets the model's CollisionGroup. The group must already exist in the game.

`Controller:SetRotation(speed: number, axis: ("X" | "Y" | "Z" | "XY" | "XZ" | "YZ" | "XYZ"))`\
Enables automatic axis rotation at the given speed (radians per frame).
Set to 0 to disable the rotation.

`Controller:Destroy()`\
Destroys the controller and disconnects all internal bindings.

### Setters
`Controller:SetActive(state: boolean)`\
Enable or disable the controller. Must be enabled to render the model.

`Controller:SetCFrame(value: CFrame)`\
Sets the model's CFrame (rotation). Only use CFrame.Angles â€” for positioning, update the adornee or its properties instead.

`Controller:SetAnchor(state: boolean)`\
Anchors or unanchors the model. Defaults to true. Anchored models are more performant.

`Controller:SetAdornee(guiObj: GuiObject)`\
Sets the GUI object (adornee) used to render the model.

`Controller:SetDepth(value: number)`\
Sets the modelâ€™s rendering depth multiplier (distance from the camera).

### Getters
`Controller:GetObject()`\
Returns the model being rendered by the controller.

`Controller:GetActive()`\
Returns whether the controller is active.

`Controller:GetCFrame()`\
Returns the current CFrame used to render the model.

`Controller:GetAnchor()`\
Returns whether the model is anchored.

`Controller:GetAdornee()`\
Returns the current adornee used for rendering.

`Controller:GetDepth()`\
Returns the current depth multiplier.

## Tips and Tricks
- You can use TweenService to animate the Adornee (position, size, rotation, etc.) and achieve powerful effects. Like a model growing on screen, a pet hatching animation, or anything like that. Since the Adornee is just a 2D GUI object, you can treat it like any other UI element for animations. Which will also apply to the Model.
- Physical properties like *CanCollide*, *CanTouch*, and *CanQuery* are automatically disabled. Keep them off to reduce overhead and maximize performance.
- Models are anchored by default and is recommended to stay that way for best performance. As shown in the benchmarks.
- If your models fall when unanchored or don't appearing on screen, they're probably not properly welded. Calling `MakeJoints()` can help fix that.
- Some specific models (like rigged ones) may still collide even with *CanCollide* set to false. To fix this, create a [CollisionGroup](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BasePart#CollisionGroup) and assign it using the `SetCollisionGroup(groupName)` method.
- If your model is colliding with Workspace objects, try using `Controller:GetObject():ScaleTo(0.1)` followed by `Controller:SetDepth(2)` (or higher). This keeps the model visually the same size and position on screen, but makes it physically smaller. Which can help avoid unwanted collisions.
  
## Notes
Zeno3D is generally more performance-intensive than ViewportFrames, but it offers key advantages: full particle support and no visual quality loss. Itâ€™s actively maintained and optimized with every version. With the latest performance updates, FPS drops are minimal â€” often unnoticeable.

That said, you wonâ€™t experience any FPS drops with three, four, or fewer models on screen. Especially if each model has fewer than 250 parts.
As shown in the benchmark, even with *16,000 parts rendered simultaneously* and graphics set to **maximum**, the latest version of Zeno3D maintained over **70 FPS** while idle. This gives you the freedom to display multiple complex models without immediately tanking performance.
